# Knight's Travails 
#### This is my solution to the Knight's Travails project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)
_______________________________________________________________
#### Purpose:
This project is designed to test the learner's knowledge of recursion and binary search trees. The program will take in start and target values and the programmer is challenged to decide the best traversal algorithm. In the end, the program will return the most efficient route of a knight (such as in chess) from start to target.
